# QuizGame
Creating a quiz game in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI) can be a fun project. To get started, you'll need to use a Java GUI library like Swing or JavaFX. In this example, we'll use Swing to create a simple multiple-choice quiz game.

Here's a step-by-step guide to create a basic quiz game using Java and Swing:

Set up Your Development Environment:
Make sure you have a Java development environment installed (e.g., JDK), and you are familiar with Java programming.

Create a New Java Project:
Create a new Java project in your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor.

Design the Quiz GUI:
Create a graphical user interface for your quiz game. In this example, we'll create a simple GUI with questions and answer choices using Swing components.
